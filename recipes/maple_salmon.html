        <h2>Description</h2>

            <p>This maple glazed salmon is delicious and very easy to prepare. 
                I love maple syrup in everything and decided to use it in the marinade.
            </p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Maple syrup:</strong> Of course, you'll need maple syrup!</li>
                <li><strong>Soy sauce:</strong> Salty soy sauce perfectly balances the sweetness of the maple syrup.</li>
                <li><strong>Garlic:</strong> Fresh garlic adds bold flavor.</li>
                <li><strong>Seasonings:</strong> This maple salmon is seasoned with garlic salt and black pepper.</li>
                <li><strong>Salmon:</strong> This recipe works for a pound of salmon, which should make about four regular-sized fillets.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
